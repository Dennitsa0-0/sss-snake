# Architecture

SSS Snake is intentionally small. It has two executable Bash scripts and no runtime dependency on Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, or curses.

## `bin/sss`

`sss` is the main entrypoint.

Responsibilities:

- parse `sss` commands such as `snake` and `status`
- parse `sss` flags such as `--no-tmux`, `--no-install`, and `--install-tmux`
- pass game flags through to `sss-snake`
- detect whether the process is already inside tmux
- detect whether `tmux` is installed
- start or attach the configured tmux session
- safely offer first-run tmux installation when tmux is missing
- fall back to direct game launch when tmux is unavailable

The default tmux session name is `sss-snake` and can be changed with `SSS_TMUX_SESSION`.

`sss` does not modify shell startup files, add autostart, upgrade the system, remove packages, download binaries, or run `curl | bash`.

## tmux Bootstrap

When tmux is missing, `sss` asks before installing anything. The normal prompt defaults to No.

Supported package managers are checked in this order:

```text
apt, dnf, yum, pacman, zypper, apk, brew
```

For non-root Linux package managers, `sss` uses `sudo` only after printing a short warning. If `sudo` is unavailable or installation fails, `sss` runs the game directly.

## `bin/sss-snake`

`sss-snake` is the game.

Responsibilities:

- parse idle/watch/game options
- size the board from terminal dimensions, environment, or CLI flags
- switch into the alternate screen buffer
- save and restore terminal state
- read keyboard input without blocking the animation loop
- draw the board in place
- run lightweight idle/watch screens, game autopilot, and manual movement
- persist the high score when enabled

The game requires Bash 4+ for associative arrays.

## Game Loop

The game uses a simple loop:

1. Draw the current frame.
2. Read one key with a timeout equal to the frame delay.
3. Apply manual input if present.
4. Step autopilot or manual movement.
5. Repeat until quit is requested.

`trap cleanup EXIT INT TERM` restores terminal state and writes the high score when needed.

## Autopilot

The default `sss` command does not run the game loop. It starts a lightweight idle screen with no AI, no fruits, no pathfinding, and low-frequency redraws.

Playable snake runs through `sss game`, `sss --game`, or `sss-snake game`.

Game mode keeps one fruit model for rendering, eating, hitbox checks, and AI targeting:

```text
fruit_x[id]
fruit_y[id]
fruit_type[id]
fruit_points[id]
fruit_grow[id]
fruit_radius[id]
```

`fruit_at x y` is the shared hitbox lookup. Normal fruits use radius `0`; `--big-food` uses radius `1`.

AUTO uses `--ai dumb` by default. The safer scorer keeps a current target fruit and uses stable scoring with straight-move preference, turn penalties, recent-position penalties, and vertical oscillation penalties. `--ai smart` is explicit and uses bounded BFS/path caching.

Debug flags:

- `--debug-hitbox` draws fruit hitboxes.
- `--debug-ai` shows target, next move, reason, and fruit-hitbox consistency warnings.

## Rendering

The game uses:

- `tput smcup` and `tput rmcup` for the alternate screen buffer
- `tput cup` for cursor positioning
- `tput civis` and `tput cnorm` for cursor visibility
- `tput setaf` for colors when available
- `NO_COLOR` to disable colors

No curses library is required.

## Persistence

The high score is stored in the XDG state directory:

```text
$XDG_STATE_HOME/sss-snake/high-score
```

If `XDG_STATE_HOME` is not set:

```text
$HOME/.local/state/sss-snake/high-score
```

Read or write failures are ignored so the game never fails because of score persistence.
